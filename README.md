# Air-Canvas
A canvas which follows the desired colour object and draws a line along its path,using OpenCv library.
Right now it just follows blue color tip of a pen or any other object,
But the values of the mask can be changed to the desired HSV values to detect an object of specific colour and draw a line along it's path.
Code will be updated soon enough to make this program better.
